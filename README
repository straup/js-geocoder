This is a simple wrapper JavaScript library to provide a single interface for a
variety of third-party geocoding services.

Additionally, you can specify multiple providers in a single request each of
which will be tried until one returns a successful response.

Sort of like this:

	var query = '475 Sansome San Francisco CA';

	var providers = ['geocoder.us' , 'google', 'placemaker', 'cloudmade', 'bing'];

	var args = {
		'providers' : providers,
		'flickr_apikey' : 'YER_FLICKR_APIKEY',
		'cloudmade_apikey' : 'YER_CLOUDMADE_APIKEY',
	};

	var doThisOnSuccess = function(rsp){
		var div = document.getElementById('output');
		div.innerHTML = rsp.lat + ',' + rsp.lon + ',' + rsp.zoom;
	};

	var doThisIfNot = function(rsp){
		var div = document.getElementById('output');
		div.innerHTML = rsp.provider + ' failed with error: ' + rsp.message;
	};

	var geo = new info.aaronland.geo.Geocoder(args);
	geo.geocode(query, doThisOnSuccess, doThisIfNot);

If you have logging turned on, you'd see something like this:

	[geocode] geocode w/ geocoder.us
	[geocode] geocoder.us failed: geonames support not complete
	[geocode] geocoding failed, trying again w/ google
	[geocode] geocode w/ google
	[geocode] google failed: missing libraries
	[geocode] geocoding failed, trying again w/ placemaker
	[geocode] geocode w/ placemaker
	[geocode] query dispatched to placemaker
	[geocode] placemaker returned OK

That's pretty much all the interface will ever look like. As of this writing it
mostly works but it's also incomplete and there are probably bugs.

Currently supported providers are:

	* Bing (http://ecn.dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6.2)

	* Cloudmade (http://cloudmade.com/products/web-maps-lite)

	* Flickr (http://github.com/straup/js-flickr-api/tree/master)

	* Google (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3)

	* Y! Placemaker (http://icant.co.uk/jsplacemaker/)

Note that you will need to include the service-specific JavaScript libraries
yourself.

Soon to be supported include:

	* Geocoder.us

	* Geonames
