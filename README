This is a simple wrapper JavaScript library to provide a single interface for a
variety of third-party geocoding services.

Additionally, you can specify multiple providers in a single request each of
which will be tried until one returns a successful response.

Sort of like this:

	var query = '475 Sansome San Francisco CA';

	var providers = ['google', 'placemaker', 'cloudmade', 'flickr', 'bing'];

	var args = {
		'providers' : providers,
		'flickr_apikey' : 'YER_FLICKR_APIKEY',
		'cloudmade_apikey' : 'YER_CLOUDMADE_APIKEY',
	};

	var geo = new info.aaronland.geo.Geocoder(args);
	geo.geocode(query, function (lat, lon, zoom) { alert("WOOT"); }, function(err) { alert("FAIL"); });

That's pretty much all the interface will ever look like. As of this writing it
mostly works but it's also incomplete and there are probably bugs.

Currently supported providers are:

	* Bing (http://ecn.dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6.2)

	* Cloudmade (http://cloudmade.com/products/web-maps-lite)

	* Flickr (http://github.com/straup/js-flickr-api/tree/master)

	* Google (http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/v3)

	* Y! Placemaker (http://icant.co.uk/jsplacemaker/)

Note that you will need to include the service-specific JavaScript libraries
yourself.

Soon to be supported include:

	* Geocoder.us

	* Geonames
